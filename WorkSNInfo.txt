Testing Desktop Serial Number:
	* Machine is built from various components rather than bought as one unit. Therefore, it has no serial number in the BIOS.
		Executing "wmic bios get serialnumber" simply returns "To be filled by OEM" string. This same string is also returned
		when executing the code that retrieves the serial number from the "Win32_BIOS" "SerialNumber" field. We might be able
		to use this string as if it returned an actual serial number if we combine it with other returned values below.
	* Executing the code that retrieves the motherboard serial number from "Win32_BaseBoard" returns a string of numbers,
		"13120225901675". This could be useful for getting a UUID.
	* Executing the code that retrieves the processor serial number had a similar result to the machine serial number. The code
		returned "To Be Filled By O.E.M.".
